# iDoHomeWork-2018-
2018 Android App project that allows students to keep track of their homework, receive reminders and take notes.

# Project Description 
I do homework is an application that helps make life easier for young students by reminding them of commitments or tasks that they have to do or deliver. This app is aimed primarily but not limited to students. 
Why are we better than the other apps?
We are better than the other applications for the simple fact that it is an application made by young high school students for other young students. We know our target public and the needs of our customers. Our application provides satisfaction with good service. An advantage that our app has that gives us the upper hand is its simplicity in the menus, since it is very easy to use and understand. Some competency apps are: the homework app, the pocket Schedule planner, and myHomework Student planner. Unlike these competitors, our app is characterized by its ease of use, without the need for tedious, long and complicated processes to understand. We have looked for a way to simplify and facilitate the process of using the app. reducing everything to simple and pleasant menus.
